## About

These files store skeleton animations. The format for storing animations in *.skl/\*.skls is similar to the format of animations embedded in [*.object](../models/object.md) files. Animations are stored in uncompressed form. Bone motion data are stored lossless when exported from a 3D editor. These formats are designed for X-Ray SDK. They are used as source files that are compiled into compressed formats for the game.

## Technical information

- Animations are stored as 3 animation curves for position and 3 curves for rotation in [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) with ZXY axis order
- A *.skls file can store one or more animations
- A *.skl file can store only one animation
- Each animation has [game parameters](../../../modding-tools/animations/omf-editor-by-valerok.md#animation-parameters).
- Skeletal animations do not support Scale keys
