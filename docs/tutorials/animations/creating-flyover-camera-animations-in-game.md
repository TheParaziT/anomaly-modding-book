## Need to know {#need-to-know}

- What is [*.xrdemo](../../references/file-formats/general/xrdemo.md)

## Start

Go into the game and in the console type `demo_record` "*your_file_name*". Now we can fly without obstacles

Press `Space` to mark the animation keys

Press `Esc` to save the animation and exit the flyover mode

Now type `demo_play` "*your_file_name*" and you'll see your recorded flyover

*.xrdemo recordings are saved in `appdata\savedgames`
